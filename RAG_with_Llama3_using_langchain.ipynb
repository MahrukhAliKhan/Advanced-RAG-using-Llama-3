       "The banking sector of Pakistan played an important role in the growth and development of the economy of Pakistan. This study aims to find the reasons behind the growth of the banking sector and how it can influence the revenue generation of the sector. The reasons are investigated and the current state of the banking sector is also reviewed to study the growth patterns. The historical evidence is first collected and then analyzed, so the current survival of the sector could be studied even after the Global Financial Crisis. Financial Soundness Indicators provide further indept analyses of the factors which contributed towards the growth of the banking sector of Pakistan. The reforms in the banking sector which are the real reasons for the growth in the banking sector are summarized under the rationale behind growth in the banking sector of Pakistan. The banking sector of Pakistan is the only sector of the economy which survived the Global Financial Crisis. So, this study provides evidence that Pakistan’s banking sector is still resilient and is profitable which suggests that it’s still a healthy sector for the investors to make safe investments with reliable and consistent returns. The government and the common man both can be benefited by the positive performance of the banking sector of Pakistan.\n",

       "The purpose of this study is to find out the main reasons of growth in the banking sector of Pakistan and how it contributes to revenue generation. As the banking sector plays an important role in the economic development of the country so the government of Pakistan must support this sector. The growth in the banking sector was observed after 1990 when liberalization was done through banking sector reforms. Bank is a financial institution which lends money and safeguards the deposits of the bank account holders. These deposits can be withdrawn by cheques. Banks are considered as financial intermediaries. The function of a financial intermediary is to sell the products designed by them to make money. The banks acquire interest by selling their obligations. The Pakistani banking sector has gone through different phases of growth. The sector was directed by the government of Pakistan to implement the development strategies till 1980’s (Hardy & Patti, 2001, p.13). To stabilize the financial and banking sector of Pakistan, the government nationalized the institutions so the declining economic growth can be revived (Akhtar et al., 2010). Later in 1990, the government of Pakistan liberalized and deregulated the banking sector. To maintain the market based banking, the government privatized the government banks and also made relaxations to help the private sector to open up new private banks. The target was to improve the management system and increase the earning of banks by strengthening the quality of assets provided by the banks. Other than this, relaxations were provided in credit control, deregulations were observed in interest rates and capital market developments helped in creation of competitive environment in the banking industry of Pakistan (Akhtar et al., 2010).\n",
       "\n",
       "The banking sector of Pakistan has gone through three phases which are pre-nationalization, nationalization and post nationalization. In pre-nationalization phase, Australian Bank Ltd. and Habib Bank Ltd. were the only two banks after the partition of Pakistan and India on August 14, 1947. For both the newly established countries, the Reserve Bank of India was performing as the central bank. A need was felt to establish the banking sector of Pakistan because the Reserve Bank of India was not performing its functions fairly for Pakistani banking industry. The Pakistani government founded State Bank of Pakistan in 1948 and National Bank of Pakistan in 1949. The Government then launched State Bank of Pakistan act in 1956 and introduced Banking Companies Ordinance in 1962 for the development of banking sector of Pakistan. The second phase began in 1974. The government decided to nationalize the banking sector by merging all the banks and established five banks. The last phase which is titled post nationalization began in 1990 when the government of Pakistan privatized the banks and denationalized two financial institutions by making amendments in National Act of 1974. The government made relaxation in the policy of "

      "The banking sector of Pakistan played an important role in the growth and development of the economy of Pakistan. This study aims to find the reasons behind the growth of the banking sector and how it can influence the revenue generation of the sector. The reasons are investigated and the current state of the banking sector is also reviewed to study the growth patterns. The historical evidence is first collected and then analyzed, so the current survival of the sector could be studied even after the Global Financial Crisis. Financial Soundness Indicators provide further indept analyses of the factors which contributed towards the growth of the banking sector of Pakistan. The reforms in the banking sector which are the real reasons for the growth in the banking sector are summarized under the rationale behind growth in the banking sector of Pakistan. The banking sector of Pakistan is the only sector of the economy which survived the Global Financial Crisis. So, this study provides evidence that Pakistan’s banking sector is still resilient and is profitable which suggests that it’s still a healthy sector for the investors to make safe investments with reliable and consistent returns. The government and the common man both can be benefited by the positive performance of the banking sector of Pakistan.\n",

      "The Banking Sector of Pakistan: The Case of Its Growth And Impact On Revenue Generation\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pakistani banking industry encompasses nationalized commercial banks, private banks, public sector banks, foreign banks, Islamic banks, specialized banks and microfinance banks. There are some companies in Pakistan which are working as banks so the financial sector can develop along with economic growth. In 1993, 33 commercial banks were functioning out of which 19 were foreign and 14 were local banks. By the end of 2001, the number of commercial banks increased to 43, out of which 19 were foreign banks and 24 were local banks (Akhtaret al., 2010). In 2010, the number of bank branches reached 9,348 which comprised of 25 domestic private banks, five public commercial banks, four specialized banks and six foreign banks (Khalabat, 2011, para 8). At present, the State Bank of Pakistan is regulating 46 banks which comprise of 39 local banks and seven foreign banks. The local banks comprise of four specialized banks, five public sector banks, five Islamic banks, eight microfinance banks and 17 private banks (State Bank of Pakistan, 2012). This indicates that the banking sector of Pakistan is growing rapidly. This research paper will contribute towards the body of knowledge of the banking sector of Pakistan. It will provide guidelines for the banking sector and it will be helpful for the government of Pakistan to formulate economic policies. Moreover, this research will help other researchers in the field. This research paper not only examines the reasons of growth in the banking sector of Pakistan but also examines the financial soundness indicators which are the real reasons of growth in the banking sector.\n",

      "II. RESEARCH OBJECTIVES\n",
      "\n",
      "The main objective of this study is to investigate the factors which contributed towards growth in the banking sector of Pakistan and how it influenced the revenue generation of the banks. The specific objectives of this research are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Historical evidences are provided to study the developments in the banking sector of Pakistan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Current overview of the banking sector is provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "Main reasons are investigated to study the rapid growth in the banking sector of Pakistan.\n",

      "III. LITERATURE REVIEW\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the partition of Pakistan and India in 1947, the banking in Pakistan was dominated by the British banks (Ghazanfar, 2011). Only two banks were located in Pakistan’s territory at the time of independence with total deposited amount of 880.0 million (Qayyum, 2007). Some banks of Pakistan faced liquidation and the payments were not made to the depositors (Ghazanfar, 2011). Steps were taken to handle such issues and to establish the banking industry of Pakistan. In 1948, State Bank of Pakistan was established (Qayyum, 2007). The operating domestic bank branches were only 25 out of 195 (Ghazanfar, 2011). The State Bank of Pakistan focused on promoting the banking industry so trade and commerce can be promoted in the country (Shirazi, 2010). The State Bank of Pakistan supported Habib Bank Limited, National Bank of Pakistan and Allied Bank Limited to achieve this objective (Khalabat, 2011). The National Bank of Pakistan was established in 1949 (Qayyum & Anwar, 2011). Agriculture Development Bank and Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan were the most outstanding establishments during the period of 60’s and 70’s (Ghazanfar, 2011). In 1961, both these financial institutions were established. The number of banks grew in Pakistan and reached to 14 with 3323 offices were established in Pakistan and 74 offices were in foreign countries (Shirazi, 2010).\n",

There are some companies in Pakistan which are working as banks so the financial sector can develop along with economic growth. In 1993, 33 commercial banks were functioning out of which 19 were foreign and 14 were local banks. By the end of 2001, the number of commercial banks increased to 43, out of which 19 were foreign banks and 24 were local banks (Akhtaret al., 2010). In 2010, the number of bank branches reached 9,348 which comprised of 25 domestic private banks, five public commercial banks, four specialized banks and six foreign banks (Khalabat, 2011, para 8). At present, the State Bank of Pakistan is regulating 46 banks which comprise of 39 local banks and seven foreign banks. The local banks comprise of four specialized banks, five public sector banks, five Islamic banks, eight microfinance banks and 17 private banks (State Bank of Pakistan, 2012). This indicates that the banking sector of Pakistan is growing rapidly. This research paper will contribute towards the body of knowledge of the banking sector of Pakistan. It will provide guidelines for the banking sector and it will be helpful for the government of Pakistan to formulate economic policies. Moreover, this research will help other researchers in the field. This research paper not only examines the reasons of growth in the banking sector of Pakistan but also examines the financial soundness indicators which are the real reasons of growth in the banking sector.\\n\\nII.
